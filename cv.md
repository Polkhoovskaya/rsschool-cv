                <li>With one arm reaching out to Asia and the other to Europe, İstanbul is the only city in the world built on two continents.
                The Bosphorus courses the waters of the Black Sea, the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn through the city’s heart.
                </li>
                <li>İstanbul's fate has been sealed by its vital strategic location and its enchanting natural beauty.
                For more than 1500 years it was the capital of three empires: Roman, Byzantine and the Ottoman Empires.
                </li>
                <li>It was beautified accordingly with magnificent monuments and became a metropolis where diverse cultures, nations and religions mingled.
                Those cultures, nations and religions are the small pieces that form the mosaic of İstanbul.
                </li>
                <li>İstanbul’s most important building works started in the Byzantine period and the city was then embellished 
                further during the days of the Ottoman Empire.</li>
